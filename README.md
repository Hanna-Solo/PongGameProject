# PongGameProject
This is a simple project I didn`t when I was learning about Python. 
It's based on a pong game.
I wanted to create something by my self without help from teacher.
My goal was to achieve learning without any help, I was looking for ideas and I saw an article about high school kids who did a final project in Cyber.
I liked the idea of writing a game.
The game is simple and easy but behind it is a crazy learning a long way to achieve. 
I looked for commands and handled errors and finally an amazing project came out.
A fun game that gave me the opportunity to learn more about Python
